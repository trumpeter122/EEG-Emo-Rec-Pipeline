# EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Research Replication

Replicate the research papers by adding them as pipelines into the project.

If the research paper does not provide enough information for building a pipeline for replication (for example, not providing the list of used EEG channels or not providing the model architecture), approximate by using already existent options or adding new options.

If the research paper's pipeline is in compatible with the project's pipeline framework, coerce them to follow the project's framework (for example, classification pipelines using different classes than 1-9 should be forced to use the 1-9 classes in this project). Try to approximate the research pipeline as close as possible as long as it follows the projects set up.
