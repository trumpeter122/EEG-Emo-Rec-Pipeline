# EEG-Based Emotion Recognition Research Replication

Replicate the research papers by adding them as pipelines into the project.

If the research paper does not provide enough information for building a pipeline for replication (for example, not providing the list of used EEG channels or not providing the model architecture), approximate by using already existent options or adding new options.

Write the implementation details in the sections down below.
